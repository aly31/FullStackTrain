Padding is the space between the element and its border.
Border has its own thickness.
Margin is the space between the DOM and the Border.

CSS display has more additional properties.
The DOM will reassign height and width of the element
depending on its boxing (padding/border/margin).
There are ways to change how its calculated...

    1. box-sizing: border-box;
        padding and border are included in the width and height.
    2. box-sizing: content-box;
        padding and border are NOT included in the width and height.

display: none 
takes no DOM space.
display: block
is normal. Takes up DOM space.
visibility: hidden
takes up DOM space but does not show the element.

getElements returns a HTMLCollection.

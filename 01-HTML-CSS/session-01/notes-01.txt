1. Never use the !important tag in css. 
It is hard to port and overwrite the !important tag.

2. Only 1 id per tag. Classes can be abused and are more flexible.

3. .class1 .class2 -> The space is significant because it implies 
nested elements, where the child element classes are towards the right,
and parent element classes are towards the left, showing a heirarchy.

4. class tags are give priority right to left if declared in the same 
element in html. 

5. In css, you can give multiple classes the same style with 
.class1.class2 or .class1, #id1

6. Pseudo classes are denoted by the colon. Look more into it.

7. Look int Immediately Invoked Functions.
